# How to install:
1. Download the zipped file and extract the files to either your desktop or VPS (Whatever youâ€™re using to host your server.)
2. Open your \resource file directory (Or whatever file directory you want this to be placed into)
3. Drag and drop the folder WeaponWheel into your server.
4. Go to your server.cfg and add the following lines into your server.cfg:
```
# Weapon Wheel Starting:
ensure WeaponWheel
```

5. After doing the steps, restart your server and the files should be started and you would see the difference when you open your weapon wheel!

# Further information:
* *All this script does, is it changes the look of both the Weapon Wheel and Radio GUI (Tab Menu for weapons + Q GUI for in vehicles) to look not only more realistic but also add some color to them making them look less.... boring?*
